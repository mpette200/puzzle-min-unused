# Puzzle
## Smallest Value Not In The List
Find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the list.

Constraints:
 * The list will only contain positive integers or zero.
 * The list could be in any order.

Examples:
 * [0, 1, 2, 3, 5] -> 4
 * [0, 1, 3, 4, 5] -> 2
 * [2, 1, 0] -> 3
 * [20, 10, 30] -> 0

Challenges:
 * Find a solution that runs in linear time.
 * Use functional programming techniques.
 * Measure computation time to confirm whether it is linear time.
